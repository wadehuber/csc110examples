# csc110examples
Code examples and videos for CSC110 - Introduction to Computer Science (Java)

This repository contains

- [Code examples & videos](./csc110examples/src/videoexamples)
- [Project starter code](./csc110examples/src/projects)
- [Starter code for select Eclipse labs](./csc110examples/src/labs)

We will be using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), so if you have not installed it, follow the directions in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBschByBEyo).  
I've also created a [page with additional links and videos](https://github.com/wadehuber/codeexamples/blob/master/programming/eclipse_setup.md) going over how to import this repo into your Eclipse workspace.
